//! UI state that outlives a run.
//!
//! Which folders you left open is not configuration — you never typed it, and
//! it would be noise in a file people edit by hand — but losing it on every
//! restart makes a deep vault tedious. It lives beside the config rather than
//! inside the vault, for the same reason sessions do: a vault should stay a
//! plain folder of Markdown that Obsidian and git are both happy with.
//!
//! What is stored is the set of folders left **open**, not the set left closed.
//! That is what keeps "collapsed by default" true for folders that appear
//! later: an unknown folder is absent from the set and so starts shut. Storing
//! the closed ones instead would make every folder added after today spring
//! open.
