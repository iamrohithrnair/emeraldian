//! Drawing pictures in the terminal.
//!
//! Terminals that speak Kitty's graphics protocol, iTerm2's, or sixel can show
//! real pixels; the rest get half-block mosaics, which are coarse but always
//! work. [`ratatui_image`] handles the encoding, and [`Picker`] asks the
//! terminal which of those it supports. That question has to be asked *before*
//! the alternate screen is entered, because it is answered on stdin.
//!
//! Two things make this awkward in a scrolling reading pane, and both are
//! handled here:
//!
//! * Encoding an image takes long enough to drop frames, so it happens on a
//!   worker thread and the pane draws a placeholder until it lands.
//! * The layout has to know how tall a picture is *before* it is decoded, or
//!   the text below it would jump when it arrives. Image headers carry the
//!   pixel size and are cheap to read, so the height is known from the first
//!   frame and the picture fades in without moving anything.
