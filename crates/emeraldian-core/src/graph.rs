//! The vault graph and its force-directed layout.
//!
//! Obsidian's graph view is the feature people open the app for, and it has to
//! stay responsive while the layout is still settling. Two decisions follow
//! from that:
//!
//! - Repulsion uses a **Barnes-Hut quadtree**, making a step O(n log n) instead
//!   of O(n²). A five-thousand-note vault stays interactive.
//! - The simulation **cools down and stops**. Motion is scaled by a factor that
//!   decays every step, so the layout's remaining travel is bounded and it
//!   always comes to rest; an idle graph costs no CPU, which matters for a
//!   program that may sit open all day. Detecting a settled layout by its
//!   energy alone is not enough — a graph of a few hundred notes oscillates
//!   below that threshold indefinitely.
//!
//! Layout is deterministic: nodes start on a fixed spiral rather than at random
//! positions, so reopening the graph shows the same picture and tests can
//! assert on it.
