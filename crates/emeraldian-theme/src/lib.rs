//! Color themes for emeraldian.
//!
//! The flow is: a [`Seed`] (a color scheme's ~20 base colors) expands into a
//! [`Theme`] (~90 semantic slots, serializable, partially overridable by the
//! user), which resolves into a [`Palette`] (the same slots as concrete
//! terminal colors) that the renderer reads every frame.
//!
//! ```
//! use emeraldian_theme::{presets, Palette};
//!
//! let theme = presets::builtin_by_name("obsidian-dark").expect("built-in theme");
//! let palette = Palette::from(&theme);
//! assert_eq!(palette.name, "obsidian-dark");
//! ```
